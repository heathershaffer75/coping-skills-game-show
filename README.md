# 🎮 The Coping Skills Game Show: *Will It Work?*

An interactive, humorous, and therapeutic group activity designed to help participants explore the effectiveness of coping strategies across different emotional states.  
Spin the wheel, draw a coping skill, debate, and vote: **Will it work?**

---

## 📝 Overview
Participants spin a **Wheel of Emotional States** (e.g., Anxiety, Rage, Grief, Shame) and draw a random coping skill.  
They then debate: *“Will this actually work in that state?”*  
The group votes, discusses tweaks, and records insights.  

Humor is added with fake sponsor interruptions, such as:  
*“Today’s panic attack is brought to you by Avoidance™!”*
